Continuous Metrics for Evaluating Single-f0 Estimation


## To-Do

- [x] Write code to use normalized energy as a proxy for confidence
- [x] Compute confidence proxy on MedleyDB-Pitch
- [x] Compute confidence proxy on IKala
- [1/2] Run pYIN (with confidence output) on MedleyDB-Pitch
- [x] Run Crepe on MedleyDB-Pitch (2 files with errors?)
- [x] Run Melodia (with confidence output) on iKala + Orchset + MedleyDB-Melody
- [ ] Run Deep Salience on iKala + Orchset + MedleyDB-Melody
- [ ] Implement new metrics
