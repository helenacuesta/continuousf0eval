Continuous Metrics for Evaluating Single-f0 Estimation


## To-Do

- [ ] Write code to use normalized energy as a proxy for confidence
- [ ] Compute confidence proxy on MedleyDB-Pitch + IKala
- [ ] Run pYIN (with confidence output) on MedleyDB-Pitch
- [ ] Run Crepe on MedleyDB-Pitch
- [ ] Run Melodia (with confidence output) on iKala + Orchset + MedleyDB-Melody
- [ ] Run Deep Salience on iKala + Orchset + MedleyDB-Melody
- [ ] Implement new metrics
